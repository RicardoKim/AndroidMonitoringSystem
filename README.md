## Planned Feature

This section outlines the features that are currently in the planning phase for the Android Monitoring System:

### Feature : Real-time Log Analysis
Description: Implement real-time log analysis capabilities to perform advanced parsing, filtering, and analysis of log data from connected Android devices.

- Objective 1: Develop a flexible log parsing mechanism to extract structured data from log messages.
- Objective 2: Implement advanced filtering options to allow users to narrow down log results based on specific criteria.
- Objective 3: Enable real-time log analysis and visualization through interactive charts and graphs.

### Feature 3: Performance Monitoring
Description: Add performance monitoring capabilities to track the performance of Android applications based on log data.

- Objective 1: Monitor resource usage (CPU, memory, network) from log metrics.
- Objective 2: Generate performance metrics and visualizations to identify bottlenecks and optimize application performance.
- Objective 3: Integrate with existing performance monitoring tools or frameworks (e.g., Grafana) for a comprehensive view.
